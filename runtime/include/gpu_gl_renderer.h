 * captures no compatibility framebuffer.  The worker later consumes every
 * immutable commit record through the SourceCommit copy API and rasterizes to
 * owned CPU staging. Only the presenter uploads/draws that immutable endpoint.
 *
 * Hold uses the existing compose(endpoint, 1, 1) service repeatedly while the
 * core keeps the endpoint's original ownership reference. Each successful
 * compose returns a separate completion fence for the core to retire. The core
 * resolves each presentation attempt before the next compose and releases the
 * endpoint exactly once on replacement/invalidation, after retiring its fences.
 * Ready textures are reused; failed composition does not consume the endpoint.
 * Native work publishes up to seven complete source-motion phases, n/(N+1)
 * for n=1..N, plus the authored endpoint at 1/1. Equivalent exact fractions are
 * accepted. N comes from the nearest integer cadence ratio between the observed
 * source interval and captured display.temporal_hz, never the monitor rate.
 * temporal_hz=0 disables smoothing before any replay/evaluation/phase allocation.
 * All phase CPU buffers are complete before endpoint/fence publication; GL
 * textures/FBOs are lazily uploaded by the presenter, never by the CPU worker.
 * Upload state is published under the endpoint lock and failed uploads retain
 * staging for retry. Phases share the endpoint's ownership/fence lifetime.
 *
 * Core schedules increasing alpha using services.clock_ns (SDL_GetTicksNS) over
 * temporal_interval_ns. Use phases only with a retained previous pixel_digest
 * equal to temporal_previous_pixel_digest and matching epoch/scene/layout.
 * Otherwise present 1/1. Zero phases authorize no temporal deferral, artificial
 * deadline or wait for a future endpoint. Pixel equality is not motion state.

/* native_work uses a worker-owned 1024x512 VRAM, initially zero. A chunk applies
 * DRAW/UPLOAD/COPY/FILL privately and publishes atomically. Mutation-only chunks
 * return APPLIED with zero outputs; display boundaries produce independent full
 * endpoints and software-ready fences. Identical pixel/layout/epoch/scene
 * boundaries with equivalent retained temporal recipes return APPLIED after all
 * mutations commit; GPU work with commands is classified only after its actual
 * storage digest is ready, never from the CPU reference alone. They do not replace the
 * published visual history or interrupt an interval. Pool backpressure returns
 * WOULD_BLOCK without applying work. GPU submissions retain one private owned
 * transaction across retries; service never publishes device/VIEW state itself.
 * Disabled boundaries produce black and
 * still require valid scanout dimensions/aspect.
 *
 * Device memory survives presentation epoch/scene/artifact changes. The source
 * must drain before those transitions and send an explicit full-VRAM upload
 * with mask_set/check disabled on reset/restore. native_vram_identity names
 * the last applied epoch/sequence.
 * No guest/compatibility memory is read. Device texturing remains affine and
 * canonical. TARGET selects an explicit non-wrapping framebuffer rectangle;
 * it never changes the device pixels or material scissor. A VIEW is maintained
 * when its width matches native_width - 2*native_offset_x. Native positions and
 * 2D anchors are rasterized separately, never by stretching the device image.
 * Unknown draws remain centered. COPY uses declared target maps and may name
 * a translated destination only when it copies the complete declared source.
 * A full unmasked VRAM replacement resets VIEW declarations and wave scratch;
 * SOURCE must emit the restored TARGET before subsequent marked draws.
 * Layout changes keep declarations but reseed derived images from the owned
 * canonical center with zero margins. No prior scene is invented in margins.
 * A recipe starts at a full unmasked FILL or a proven full-target, untextured,
 * opaque uniform rectangle. The latter is retained as the first draw, including
 * deterministic dither and mask state; fades and partial scissors are not clears.
 * The bounded target registry has 64 entries. Wave margins use complete 20x17
 * cohorts and declared VIEW source rows; incomplete/unsupported cohorts leave
 * the actual draw/copy result intact and increment view_wave_incomplete instead
 * of blocking valid device work or inventing a fullscreen warp.
 *
 * The separate scene-builder lane retains its compiled-surface carry cache.
 * Unlike native_work FIFO, that cache cannot reconstruct omitted delta sources.
 * Movie/UI endpoints in that lane remain discrete.
 *
 * Complete recipes retain motion snapshot generations independently of source
 * commits, including across COPY/COW and visual-history retention. Texture
 * data is retained per draw, with at most 16 immutable snapshot versions
 * per recipe. Later writes outside the target do not invalidate past samples;
 * subsequent draws capture refreshed data. Provenance records actual canonical
 * fragment writes, not inclusive bounding boxes or transparent/masked pixels.
 * Fully copied targets inherit their source recipe and its draw-time snapshots.
 * Replay must match both canonical and VIEW planes. A phase evaluates each
 * entity's XgRenderMotionPose once, reuses it for every local-vertex binding and
 * for both planes, then projects. motion.c owns local TRS/quaternion slerp and
 * hierarchy/camera composition. Unbound source vertices may instead share an
 * exact scene/group/vertex pair and its projected displacement; primitive identity
 * is not required for that source-keyed path. No proximity matching or image
 * blending is used. Unknown draws remain authored/discrete.
 * An unbound draw in a bound entity's authored producer namespace, conflicting
 * entity/camera snapshots, incompatible lifecycle or CLIP_REQUIRED rejects the
 * affected entity/component before phase rendering. The real endpoint and FIFO
 * remain valid and unchanged.
 * Renderer phases only read immutable recipe texture/CLUT data and write new
 * buffers, never committed canonical or VIEW pixels.
 * Temporal publications are consumed at their before_operation FIFO gaps,
 * including trailing metadata-only gaps. A scope replaces its complete snapshot;
 * recipe/history retain exact retired resource refs independently of commits.
 * Explicit component IDs partition atomic meshes within their producer scope.
 * Visibility anchors may come only from the immediate compatible publication,
 * never a last-seen vertex cache. Empty/intermediate publications break stale A.
 *
 * render_scale > 1 routes a complete ordered operation journal, not just motion
 * recipes, to the owner-thread Native GPU service. The CPU device and reference VIEW
 * stay 1x. All raw texture inputs are copied at their execution boundaries; GPU
 * COPY reads frozen high-resolution source planes. Only private GPU planes are
 * modified before the worker atomically applies the completed transaction.
 * The independent CPU VIEW raster may run on its ordered reader. Canonical writes
 * intersecting its conservative texture/CLUT read set, transfers, target changes,
 * failure cleanup and publication drain that reader before mutating/freeing input.
 * Endpoint width/height remain guest dimensions; storage dimensions are physical.
 * GPU image digests hash actual RGBA storage through fenced PBOs. Logical reference
 * digests are separate and never stand in for those images. Optional guest
 * comparison samples the original logical grid from the actual GPU endpoint.
 * Movies with intrinsically packed 24-bit pixels keep their original storage. */
