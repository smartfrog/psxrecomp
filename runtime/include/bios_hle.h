/* bios_hle.h — opt-in High-Level Emulation tier for PSX BIOS kernel services.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §0 AMENDMENT 2026-07-02 (the gbarecomp model, see the sibling
 * gbarecomp project's src/runtime/bios_hle.h): the recompiled real
 * BIOS (LLE) is the DEFAULT, the reference implementation, and the
 * correctness/timing oracle. HLE is an *alternative backend*, selected
 * per-game via `[runtime] bios_hle = true` in game.toml (PSX_BIOS_HLE env
 * override). Every kernel service the HLE layer does not implement
 * transparently falls through to the recompiled BIOS, so HLE is never
 * load-bearing beyond what it covers and never becomes the oracle.
 *
 * Mechanism: psx_bios_hle_configure() installs (or leaves NULL) the dispatch
 * hook g_psx_bios_hle_hook consulted at the top of every psx_dispatch_impl
 * iteration (emitted by full_function_emitter.cpp), BEFORE any backend claims
 * the target. The hook sees the pre-normalize physical address; when the
 * target is a kernel service vector (0xA0/0xB0/0xC0, function number in $t1)
 * and the service is implemented, the handler computes its effect directly on
 * guest state (the REAL kernel structures in guest RAM — EvCB table etc., per
 * docs/psx_bios_disasm.txt + the SCPH1001 kernel disassembly), charges an
 * approximate cycle cost, and returns 1: the guest resumes at $ra with no
 * BIOS dispatch. NULL hook (default) = pure LLE, byte-identical dispatch.
 *
 * Boot HLE: with the tier on (and no keep-intro opt-out) the hook also
 * intercepts the first dispatch of the BIOS SHELL entry (RAM 0x30000 — the
 * boot animation; LoadRunShell's indirect `0x80030000()` call always routes
 * through the dispatcher) and returns immediately, so BIOS Main() proceeds
 * straight to step 8 (SYSTEM.CNF + game EXE load) with kernel state built
 * entirely by the REAL recompiled kernel init. The frontend runs unpaced
 * (turbo) until game handoff. This is THE boot-skip mechanism; it deprecates
 * the old fast_boot snapshot restore.
 *
 * The boot-skip is BIOS-INDEPENDENT and works under pure LLE. It needs only
 * the image's shell_entry_phys anchor — nothing is synthesized, the shell call
 * just returns immediately — so it fires identically on retail SCPH-1001 and
 * on the bundled OpenBIOS, whose kernel-call HLE is separately (and correctly)
 * refused for want of a DeliverEvent anchor. bios_hle_plan.h documents why the
 * two axes must not be collapsed; deriving the skip from the granted call-HLE
 * axis is exactly the bug that made the flag mean different things per BIOS.
 * With the tier fully off, LLE plays the real intro.
 *
 * NO-STUBS STANDS: every handler here is a validated reimplementation of the
 * documented kernel mechanism operating on the real guest structures — never
 * a "return the answer" fake. Timing is approximate (documented limitation;
 * LLE remains the timing oracle).
 *
 * Observability (CLAUDE.md rule 3 + the global ring-buffer rule): every hook
 * decision is recorded in an always-on ring queryable over the TCP debug
 * server ("hle_dump"), never armed, never polled.
