/* dirty_ram_interp.h — interpret-on-dispatch for install-at-runtime RAM.
 *
 * See CLAUDE.md Rule 18 and docs/dynamic_handler_install.md for the full
 * rationale.  The PS1 BIOS dynamically writes 4-instruction dispatch stubs
 * into kernel RAM (notably RAM 0xCF0 for the SIO data-byte handler).  A
 * static recompiler can't see those bytes at compile time, so a small MIPS
 * interpreter here runs them at dispatch time on the same CPUState.
 *
 * Scope: this is NOT a fallback for code the recompiler failed to translate.
 * It runs only against PCs in pages that have been written-to since boot.
 * Static-recompiled code continues to handle ROM-resident code and game
 * RAM.  See docs/dynamic_handler_install.md for the inline note about a
 * potential future migration to runtime JIT (Option B).
